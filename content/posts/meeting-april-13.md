Hi everyone,

Here's what's happening this month:

Saturday, April 13
9am –12 pm
Northbrook's annual Earth & Arbor Day event is looking for EV owners to exhibit their cars. 
You can find more info [here](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.northbrook.il.us%2F819%2FCommunity-Events&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNGK2To_rBZUB1IIjP3BWd2r_4m-JA), and if you can make it, 
please email me by clicking [here](mailto:neda@chicagoevs.org) so I can give you more logistical details.

We're working on participating in two other Earth Day events the last weekend of April (27 & 28) in Skokie and Chicago. I'll let you know once they're confirmed!

Next meeting scheduled:
Saturday, April 20
