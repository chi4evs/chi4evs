## How you can help

#### Contact your state representative

It's a good idea to contact your Illinois State House representative. To find out their contact information, 
you can use [this interactive map](https://www.illinoispolicy.org/maps/illinois-house/). 

Tell your representative why you think our state needs this bill. If you can, try to persuade them to become a co-sponsor. The more
co-sponsors a bill has, the more likely it would be to pass.

But even if your rep doesn't want to co-sponsor the Electric Vehicle Charging Act, knowing that their constituents 
want it to pass will help the bill get through the House.
