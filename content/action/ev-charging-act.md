Be sure to choose the Create Witness Slip icon. The icon is next to HB 4284, Electric Vehicle Charging Act. It looks like a piece of paper and pencil.

Feel free to fill out the witness slip on behalf of yourself as individual. 
Unless you represent an organization, your "title" or "firm" can be given as "none." 

You may file written testimony if you want to share your personal story that shows why you think Illinois needs this Act. 
Otherwise, just choose only record of appearance, marking yourself as a proponent of the original bill.

#### Contact your state representative

It's also a good idea to contact your Illinois State House representative. To find out their contact information, 
you can use [this interactive map](https://www.illinoispolicy.org/maps/illinois-house/). 
If your rep is on the [Energy & Environment Committee](http://www.ilga.gov/house/committees/members.asp?committeeID=2355), your call
will make it more likely that the bill will advance. But even if they are not, support from constituents will help the bill 
when it reaches the House floor.
