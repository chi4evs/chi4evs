On March 10, 2019, Wilmette hosted the annual [Going Green Matters](https://www.goinggreenmatters.org/) fair.

EV drivers -- many of them members of Chicago4EVs -- provided shuttle service for the fair's attendees 
from the visitor parking lot to the event less than a mile away. In just a couple minutes' drive, 
we were able to talk to people about our EVs, answer their questions, enjoy some instant torque, 
and even convinced several people to buy electric for their next car. This is why getting butts in seats is so effective!

<small>Many attendees joked this was better than Uber â€“ free, clean & green ride back to the parking lot.</small>
