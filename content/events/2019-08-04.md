On August 4 2019, *Chicago for EVs'* Neda, Anton, and Spencer gave a presentation at the 
[Northbrook Library](https://www.northbrook.info/).

We explained the basics of EVs, highlighted their features and environmental advantages over gas cars, 
busted some common myths, and shared our experience of what it's like to live with an electric car.

After the presentation, we invited the attendees to look at EVs brought by our volunteers.
We had a Chevy Bolt, a Tesla Model 3, and a first-generation Nissan Leaf.

People asked us lots of questions about charging and maintenance costs (low!), 
range (high enough for all of us!), and what it's like to take 
long trips (fun! although maybe not with the Leaf).

The librarian liked our presentation so much that she shared our contact information with other libraries 
in the Chicago area and the rest of Illinois. Some of them have already invited us to give similar presentations
to the communities. 

So, in the near future, we will be travelling all around the Chicago area (and even a bit far from the Chicago area)
to spread the word about driving electric!
