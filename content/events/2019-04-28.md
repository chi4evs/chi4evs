As part of [Drive Electric Earth Day,](https://driveelectricearthday.org/event.php?eventid=1877)
*Chicago for EVs* participated in an Earth Day Celebration at the 
[Emily Oaks Nature Center in Skokie](https://www.skokieparks.org/emily-oaks-nature-center/).
Thanks to the Nature Center's staff, we got a prime spot right by the entrance to the Center, 
where we showed off our electric cars and talked to attendees of the event about the 
benefits of switching from gas to electric.

The event helped us reach dozens of people and answer their questions. Many of them
asked about specific aspects of living with an EV, and told us they appreciated the opportunity of speaking
with real-life owners of EVs, who were friendly, well-informed, and, unlike car dealers or salespeople, 
did not press them to buy anything. As our volunteers said, the only thing we were selling was the idea -- 
that driving electric instead of gas can benefit both them and the world around them.

As is the case with many such events, many of the people we spoke with had never experienced an EV up close.
We helped change that! Volunteers who brought their cars --  a Nissan Leaf, a Tesla Model 3, 
and two Chevrolet Bolts -- invited people to sit inside them, or go on test rides.

Like most drivers of EV, all of our volunteers told the attendees 
that their electric car was the best car they had ever owned.

Some people went on rides in all of the different models, just to see how each one felt. 
Afterwards, they said that that experience convinced them to buy an EV as their next car.

We hope they follow through with that decision. 

Big thanks to the Emily Oaks Nature Center for giving 
us space at their Earth Day Celebration! *Chicago for EVs* will participate in future events 
to help more people learn about the benefits and fun of driving electric.
