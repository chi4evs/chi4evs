Members of *Chicago for EVs* take part in events to promote electric vehicles and spread information.

Many people in the general public have little first-hand experience with EVs.

For some events, we bring our cars and let members of the public look at them, sit in them, and sometimes even
ride along with us -- the latter is sometimes called "getting butts in seats", and has proven to be one of the most
effective ways of convincing people to switch to electric. Once people appreciate the smooth and quiet drive with
zippy acceleration, they understand why owners of EVs love their cars a little more than the average person.

Here you can find reports from past events.
