The mission of Chicago For EVs is to promote electrification of transport in Chicagoland and the state of Illinois. We approach that mission in two ways:

1. Hold [outreach events](/events) to educate the general public about the individual benefits of switching to an electric car, and
2. Work with state and local politicians, officials, and stakeholders to make our city, neighbouring communities, and the state as a whole 
into a place where sustainable transportation is accessible and convenient for all. 

Both of these goals are integral to our work. Individuals who want to get an EV may encounter barriers to owning one (say, if they can't charge at home),
 if our city or state does not adopt policies that would eliminate or reduce those barriers. At the same time, even the most robust policies
will do little on their own, if the most people don't know that electric transportation can be a better option for them.

On this page, you can find a list of policy initiatives that are pioneered or supported by Chicago For EVs.
We are a small group of volunteers, so we are always grateful to get more help!
